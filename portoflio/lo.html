                <p> For the social sphere project, I conducted a comprehensive
                    analysis of our target users,
                    specifically the youth workers in Eindhoven. This involved a
                    deep dive into their needs, preferences, and challenges
                    within the digital landscape. The creation of personas and

                    proposing a visual representation demonstrated an
                    understanding of user perceptions and behaviors.</p>
                <p>In the creation of my portfolio website for the advanced
                    media design semester, my focus on user interaction was
                    integral to addressing the main research question:
                    "How can the integration of interactive and aesthetic aspects, and AI technologies enhance the user experience on a website?"</p>
                <p>For the planet project,The design of the travel poster

                    involvement in the development process and the subsequent
                    evaluation of the user experience. Through meticulous
                    documentation, I provided stakeholders with insights into
                    the developmental journey, ensuring transparency and
                    accountability in the execution of the project.</p>

                    how they interacted with the site and make improvements
                    accordingly. Documentation of the development process
                    provided stakeholders with insights into the iterative
                    journey, fostering transparency and accountability.</p>
                <p>For the planet project, The journey video served as an
