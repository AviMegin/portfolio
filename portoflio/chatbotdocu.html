                            <p>I decided to make a competitive
                                analysis to look up inspiration
                                for what a portfolio website
                                looks like, and compare my ideas
                                and see what is a universal
                                theme that people use, this will
                                make my website less confusing
                                and familiar to the target
                                audience.</p><p>So first I found a portfolio
                                website hub, that contains alot
                                of portfolio websites, below I
                                will show which ones caught my
                                eye. I will take inspiration and
                                make a list of potential
                                additions to my portfolio, I
                                will then do further research
                                into each one of them to see if
                                it is realistic to add them, and
                                filter out until I have a solid
                                list of extra widgets and ideas
                                for the portfolio</p>
                            <b>Results</b>
                            <p>Overall the feel of the websites
                                is the same, the endless
                                scrolling is something that
                                bothered me, so i will not be
                                doing that for my portfolio. But
                                I have created a nice list of
                                additions that I personally
                                enjoy, I will be making a
                                prototype for my idea and see if
                                the world agrees with my vision</p></div>

                                In conclusion, I want to add a
                                chatbot AI to my portfolio
                                because it will make it more
                                informative, engaging, and
                                innovative. <br>
                                <b>More informative:</b> A chatbot AI
                                can answer questions about my
                                portfolio and provide visitors
                                with more information about my
                                work. I will train the chatbot
                                to have a comprehensive
                                knowledge of my projects, but I
                                will not train it to copy my
                                personality. This will create a
                                certain barrier between ethics,
                                by putting up these boundaries. <br>
                                <b>More engaging: </b>A chatbot AI can
                                create more interactive and
                                immersive experiences for my
                                portfolio visitors. For example,
                                I could create a chatbot that
                                takes visitors on a virtual tour
                                of my portfolio, or that allows
                                them to ask questions about my
                                work in a more conversational
                                way. <br>
                                <b>More innovative: </b>A chatbot AI
                                demonstrates my skills in areas
                                such as artificial intelligence,
                                machine learning, and natural
                                language processing.
                                In addition to these benefits, I
                                believe that adding a chatbot AI
                                to my portfolio will help me to
                                stand out from the competition
                                and to make a positive
                                impression on potential
                                employers.
                                I am excited to experiment with
                                different ways to use a chatbot
                                AI in my portfolio. I think it
                                has the potential to be a really
                                valuable asset and to help me to
                                create a truly unique and
                                memorable experience for my
                                visitors.

                            <p>Prototyping enables iterative
                                design by allowing designers to
                                quickly make changes and
                                improvements based on feedback,
                                without the need for extensive
                                coding or development. This
                                saves time in the design
                                process.Catching design flaws
                                and making necessary adjustments
                                early in the design phase
                                through prototyping helps
                                prevent rework during
                                development, ultimately saving
