                            For the creation of my portfolio, <b>made a project
                                plan </b> with all the DOTS framework methods I
                            was going to use .The journey began with an
                            in-depth
                            competitive analysis, where I delved into the
                            portfolios
                            of industry leaders, seeking inspiration while
                            identifying key trends and design elements that
                            resonate
                            with both aesthetic appeal and functionality.
                            <br><br>
                            To ensure my portfolio stands out in the digital
                            landscape, <b>I conducted an exhaustive analysis of
                                available products</b> within the same domain.
                            This
                            process
                            involved dissecting various portfolio styles, noting
                            the
                            strengths and weaknesses of each, and extracting
                            valuable insights to inform my unique approach.
                            <br>
                            Embracing a <b>user-centric philosophy</b>, I
                            initiated the
                            design phase by developing a prototype that embodied
                            my
                            personal style preferences. This phase allowed me to
                            channel my creativity into a tangible visual
                            representation, ensuring that every aspect of the
                            portfolio reflected my individuality.

                                the site with a timeless and elegant

                        <p> The journey didn't stop at the prototype; it
                            extended
                            into the realm of A/B testing. By presenting subtle
                            variations of the design to a select audience, I

                            refining the design, prioritizing user satisfaction,

                        <div class="flexi"> <img src="medusa-5644531_1920.png"
                                alt><p> The user testing phase was a crucial
                                milestone, where
                                real-world users provided invaluable feedback.
                                Their
                                insights were integrated, leading to a portfolio
                                that
                                not only mirrors my personal style but also
                                caters to

                        <p> One distinctive feature of my portfolio is the
                            commitment to a non-scrolling website. This design
                            choice was deliberate, aimed at breaking away from
                            the
                            conventional scrolling experience. The intent is to
                            immerse visitors in a seamless, story-like
                            navigation,
                            eliminating the need for lengthy scrolls through
                            monotonous text. The non-scrolling design creates an
                            illusion, inviting users to explore different
                            sections
                            effortlessly, each unveiling a unique facet of my
                            skills, projects, and personality. I also found that
                            most people dont
                            actually read the whole text, they usually stick
                            with the titles and maybe th first sentence, so
                            making important points <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i>
                            is great convince to the reader, since now they
                            can glaze over the text with ease, still getting
                            all the important points</p>

                                In essence, my portfolio is not just a

                                works; it's a thoughtfully curated digital

                        <p>When I started designing my website, I aimed for a
                            cool
                            magazine look. Picture flipping through colorful
                            pages
                            online. But, after checking with users, it turned
                            out it
                            wasn't so practical. IF everytime you wanted to see
                            more
                            content, you had to go through a slow page flipping
                            animation, it would certainly become annoying</p>

                                scrolling sideways? It seemed interesting, but
                                when
                                people tried it, it got confusing. It didn't
                                work as
                                well as I hoped. I still wanted to maintain the
                                effect of "not a boring long text website"</p>

                            with
                            a Newspaper Twist</h3>
                        <p>I took a step back and learned from the
                            experiments.
                            Going back to my first idea of <b><i>parallax
                                    scrolling </i></b>, I
                            added a touch of a traditional newspaper layout.
                            This
                            time, it felt just right—keeping things
                            interesting
                            but
                            also easy to use.In the end, my website got its
                            groove with a mix of
                            parallax scrolling and a regular newspaper
                            layout.
                            This
                            way, it's easy for people to click around while
                            still
                            looking good. Learning from mistakes and
                            listening
                            to
                            users helped me get there, making the site both
                            cool
                            and

                        <div class="flexi"> <p> In wrapping up my portfolio
                                creation journey, I
                                wanted to share how I carefully blended style
                                with
                                substance. Starting with a deep dive into what
                                the
                                cool kids in the industry were doing
                                (competitive
                                analysis), I picked up on trends that not only
                                looked good but also worked well. <br>

                            </p>

                            <img src="skull-8135218_1920.png" alt>
                        </div>

                        <p> Next, I wanted my portfolio to <b>be more than just
                                pretty pictures</b> . So, I kicked off the
                            design phase
                            by creating a prototype that screamed <i>"me"</i>.
                            It was
                            like giving my creativity a visual form. But guess
                            what? It didn't end there. I stumbled upon some
                            amazing black and white visuals while hunting for
                            free-to-use images. It sparked a lightbulb moment,
                            and suddenly my portfolio had this timeless and
                            elegant vibe.</p>

                        <div class="flexi"> <img style="height: 400px;"
                                src="head-5782972_1920.png" alt>
                            <p> Now,
                                let's talk testing. I didn't just sit back and
                                hope for the best. <b>I put my designs to the
                                    test</b> ,
                                literally. A/B testing became my best friend. I
                                threw different versions at a select group,
                                watched
                                how they interacted, and tweaked things based on
                                their feedback. It was like having a
                                conversation
                                with my future visitors without actually
                                talking.

                            </p>

                        </div>
                        <p> Real-world users were the real MVPs. Their
                            insights
                            were gold. I listened, learned, and made my
                            portfolio not just about me but about what people
                            wanted to see. And oh, I ditched the regular
                            scrolling thing. Who needs that when you can have an
                            immersive, story-like journey through different
                            sections?
                            Finally, let's talk about the layout evolution. I
                            started with a dream of a cool magazine look, tried
                            making it feel like reading a book (didn't work),
                            but eventually found the sweet spot – a mix of
                            parallax scrolling and a regular newspaper layout.
                            It looks good, and people can easily click around.
                            Learning from mistakes and listening to users made
                            all the difference.
                        </p><p>
                            So, in a nutshell, my portfolio is not just a
                            collection of my works. It's a digital adventure
                            where visitors can engage, explore, and connect with
                            my professional journey in a way that's both cool
                            and user-friendly. And all of this was possible by
                            combining interactive and aesthetic elements,
                            sprinkled with a touch of AI magic.</p>
