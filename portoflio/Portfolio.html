                        I chose a vintage botanic garden vibe
                        for my portfolio because it is unique,
                        timeless, versatile, and conveys a sense
                        of professionalism and sophistication.
    
                        It is unique and eye-catching. A vintage
                        botanic garden vibe is not as common as
                        other design choices, such as a
                        minimalist or modern look. This can make
                        my portfolio stand out from the crowd
                        and grab the attention of potential
                        employers.
                        It is a timeless and classic style.
                        Vintage design is always in fashion, and
                        a botanic garden theme is both elegant
                        and natural. This means that my
                        portfolio will still look good even
                        years down the road.</p>
                    <p>It is versatile and adaptable. A vintage
                        botanic garden vibe can be used to
                        create a variety of different looks,
                        from traditional to whimsical. This
                        flexibility makes it a good choice for
                        portfolios of all kinds, whether I am a
                        graphic designer, web designer, or
                        artist.
                        It conveys a sense of professionalism
                        and sophistication. A well-designed
                        vintage botanic garden portfolio shows
                        that I am creative, detail-oriented, and
                        have a good eye for design. This can
                        make a positive impression on potential
                        employers and help me land my dream job.
                        I also chose this vibe because I
                        personally love it. It is something that
                        I am passionate about and that I feel
                        reflects my personality. I believe that
                        this passion will come through in my
                        portfolio and make it even more
                        effective.</p>

                        <h3>Exploring Styles: Going for a Magazine Vibe</h3>
                        <p>When I started designing my website, I aimed for a cool
                            magazine look. Picture flipping through colorful pages
                            online. But, after checking with users, it turned out it
                            wasn't so practical. IF everytime you wanted to see more
                            content, you had to go through a slow page flipping
                            animation, it would certainly become annoying</p>
                        <h3>Trying Something New: Book Vibes with Sideways Scrolling</h3>
                        <p>I thought, what if the site felt like reading a book,
                            scrolling sideways? It seemed interesting, but when
                            people tried it, it got confusing. It didn't work as
                            well as I hoped.</p>
                        <h3>Learning and Revisiting: Back to Parallax Scrolling with
                            a Newspaper Twist</h3>
                        <p>I took a step back and learned from the experiments.
                            Going back to my first idea of parallax scrolling, I
                            added a touch of a traditional newspaper layout. This
                            time, it felt just rightâ€”keeping things interesting but
                            also easy to use.In the end, my website got its groove with a mix of
                            parallax scrolling and a regular newspaper layout. This
                            way, it's easy for people to click around while still
                            looking good. Learning from mistakes and listening to
                            users helped me get there, making the site both cool and
                            user-friendly.</p>

                        <p>I decided to make a competitive
                            analysis to look up inspiration
                            for what a portfolio website
                            looks like, and compare my ideas
                            and see what is a universal
                            theme that people use, this will
                            make my website less confusing
                            and familiar to the target
                            audience.</p><p>So first I found a portfolio
                            website hub, that contains alot
                            of portfolio websites, below I
                            will show which ones caught my
                            eye. I will take inspiration and
                            make a list of potential
                            additions to my portfolio, I
                            will then do further research
                            into each one of them to see if
                            it is realistic to add them, and
                            filter out until I have a solid
                            list of extra widgets and ideas
                            for the portfolio</p>
                        <b>Results</b>
                        <p>Overall the feel of the websites
                            is the same, the endless
                            scrolling is something that
                            bothered me, so i will not be
                            doing that for my portfolio. But
                            I have created a nice list of
                            additions that I personally
                            enjoy, I will be making a

                            to have a comprehensive
                            knowledge of my projects, but I
                            will not train it to copy my
                            personality. This will create a
                            certain barrier between ethics,
                            by putting up these boundaries. <br>
                            <b>More engaging: </b>A chatbot AI can
                            create more interactive and
                            immersive experiences for my
                            portfolio visitors. For example,
                            I could create a chatbot that
                            takes visitors on a virtual tour
                            of my portfolio, or that allows
                            them to ask questions about my
                            work in a more conversational
                            way. <br>
                            <b>More innovative: </b>A chatbot AI
                            demonstrates my skills in areas
                            such as artificial intelligence,
                            machine learning, and natural
                            language processing.
                            In addition to these benefits, I
                            believe that adding a chatbot AI
                            to my portfolio will help me to
                            stand out from the competition
                            and to make a positive
                            impression on potential
                            employers.
                            I am excited to experiment with
                            different ways to use a chatbot
                            AI in my portfolio. I think it
                            has the potential to be a really
                            valuable asset and to help me to
                            create a truly unique and
                            memorable experience for my
                            visitors.

                        <p>Prototyping enables iterative
                            design by allowing designers to
                            quickly make changes and
                            improvements based on feedback,
                            without the need for extensive
                            coding or development. This
                            saves time in the design
                            process.Catching design flaws
                            and making necessary adjustments
                            early in the design phase
                            through prototyping helps
                            prevent rework during
                            development, ultimately saving
                            time and reducing project costs.</p>
