                            First I decided to make a competitive analysis,
                            to
                            see what others have done for their
                            portfolios. Deciding to elevate my portfolio by
                            undertaking a competitive analysis is a
                            step I believe has greatly enhanced its
                            overall appeal. I started by exploring a
                            portfolio website hub to identify design
                            elements that caught my eye, with the
                            intention of incorporating universal
                            themes that would make my website
                            both distinctive and user-friendly.
                            This
                            process
                            involved dissecting various portfolio styles,
                            noting
                            the
                            strengths and weaknesses of each, and extracting
                            valuable insights to inform my unique approach.
                            From doing this I derived a short list of cool
                            things to possibly add to my portfolio website:
                            <li>Track location of the mouse</li>
                            <li>Parallax scrolling</li>
                            <li>
                                Hover effects</li>
                            <li>
                                Changing colors of website based on subject</li>
                            <li>Intro animation</li>
                            <li>Magazine/newspaper aesthetic</li>
                            <li>Sideways scrolling</li>
                            <br>
                            further along a validated these ideas within the
                            portfolio and actually coded website, if they are
                            user friendly and/or usefull at all.

                            Next up, I wanted to do the same thing but for the
                            specific chatbot I was thinking of making.
                            looking
                            at
                            already existing chatbots that other
                            people
                            made, specifically the ones they made of
                            themselves.
                            How
                            they utilize and enhance their website. This
                            concluded in that most people dont have one on
                            their
                            portfolio, and even the ones that do, dont get
                            used
                            often. <br> Further along in user testing it
                            appeared to
                            be useless to even attempt to make a chatbot, since
                            visitor of the portfolio did not require one</p>

                                images, I
                                stumbled upon <b>captivating black and
                                    white visuals</b> that sparked a
                                significant
                                shift in the website's aesthetic. Embracing
                                this change, I adapted my portfolio to
                                align with the newfound theme, infusing
                                the site with a timeless and elegant
                                essence.

                                One distinctive feature of my portfolio is the
                                commitment to a non-scrolling website. This
                                design
                                choice was deliberate, aimed at <i>breaking away

                                    the
                                    conventional scrolling experience.</i> The
                                intent is to
                                immerse visitors in a seamless, story-like
                                navigation,

                                navigation,
                                <b>eliminating the need for lengthy scrolls</b>
                                through
                                monotonous text. The non-scrolling design
                                creates an
                                illusion, inviting users to explore different
                                sections
                                effortlessly, each unveiling a unique facet of

                                    found

                                    most people dont
                                    actually read the whole text</b>, they
                                usually
                                stick
                                with the titles and maybe th first sentence, so
                                making important points <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i>
                                is great convince to the reader, since now they
                                can glaze over the text with ease, still getting
                                all the important points</p>
                            <p>When I started designing my website, I aimed for
                                a
                                cool
                                magazine look. Picture flipping through colorful
                                pages
                                online. But, after checking with users, it
                                turned
                                out it
                                wasn't so practical. IF everytime you wanted to
                                see
                                more
                                content, you had to go through a slow page
                                flipping
                                animation, it would certainly become annoying</p>

                            <div class="flexi"> <p>I thought, what if the site
                                    felt
                                    like reading a book,
                                    scrolling sideways? It seemed interesting,
                                    but
                                    when
                                    people tried it, it got confusing. It didn't
                                    work as
                                    well as I hoped. I still wanted to maintain
                                    the
                                    effect of "not a boring long text website"</p>

                            <p>I took a step back and learned from the
                                experiments.
                                Going back to my first idea of <b><i>parallax
                                        scrolling </i></b>, I
                                added a touch of a traditional newspaper layout.
                                This
                                time, it felt just right—keeping things
                                interesting
                                but
                                also easy to use.In the end, my website got its
                                groove with a mix of
                                parallax scrolling and a regular newspaper
                                layout.
                                This
                                way, it's easy for people to click around while
                                still
                                looking good. Learning from mistakes and
                                listening
                                to
                                users helped me get there, making the site both
                                cool
                                and
