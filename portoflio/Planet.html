                    <p>
                        The inhabitants of Earth acknowledge the challenges
                        facing their planet and express gratitude for the
                        presence of a visitor, presumably an extraterrestrial
                        entity, to help find sustainable solutions. A universal
                        translator has been provided for effective
                        communication, and facilities are equipped with the same
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>This was the introduction to the project, short summary,
                        all the media design classes of fontys were gathered in
                        the first week of the semester. Everyone was assigned a
                        planet, mine being <a style="color: black;"

                    <p>With the process of natural selection. and no one really
                        wanting to do this project, <b>I was assigned leader of
                            my

                    <p>
                        KELT-9b is a large, hot exoplanet, over twice the size
                        of Jupiter. Tidally locked to its star, it's losing its
                        atmosphere quickly due to intense radiation.As of 2022,
                        it's the hottest known exoplanet, with scorching
                        temperatures causing molecules to break apart on the
                        dayside and reform on the cooler nightside. <br><br> As
                        the
                        Health & recreation we came up with how our "species"
                        could live on this planet. We live around the planet in
                        the sky, we fuel our starlite floating colonies with the
                        gasses from the planet below, Starlite was able to
                        withstand attack by a laser beam that could produce a
                        temperature of 10,000 degrees. Live demonstrations also
                        showed how an egg coated in Starlite could remain raw,
                        and cold enough to be picked up with a bare hand, even
                        after five minutes in the flame of a blowtorch. <br>

                        The
                        keltarans are bioluminescence blue beings that can self
                        sustain by meditation. this makes the Keltarans
                        self-sustaining, not needing food or water as their own
                        body produces the necessary components to stay alive,
                        the mediation is required to keep this process going
                        smoothly.<br> We wrote this down into a lovely story you
                        can read here! <a style="color: black;" target="_blank"
                            href="Kelt 9B.pdf">Background story</a> if you
                        really feel like it, you must be very bored, its very
                        long.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 id="travel">Travel poster</h2>
                    <p>To convince "humans" that our planet was nice we had to
                        make a poster to advertise it, depicted here on the
                        right ---> <br></p>
                    <h2 id="travel">Prototype</h2>
                    <p>After establishing our planets background story, we had
                        to create some sort of prototype that would help
                        "humans" and their planet improve, My department chose
                        to fix the problem
                        "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"
                        we decided to do this via unethical ways. Mainly
                        transforming everyon into well "us". by transforming
                        everyone into keltarans, inequality would be solved. <br>
                        The prototyp we decided to make was a 3D model of the
                        machines used for this transformation, a drawing of how
                        the keltarans would look, and a 3D model of the ship we
                        arrived to earth on <img src="Ship.jpeg" alt></p>
                    <h2 id="video">Journey video</h2>
                    <p>Finally it was time, to conclude the project and combine
                        everything, we decided to focus on our prototype
                        storyline. You know the whole, taking over the planet by
                        converting all humans. I edited this video, using shameless stock footage, its about the general idea
