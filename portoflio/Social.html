                            <h1>Introduction</h1>

                            Garage2020 is collaborating closely with the
                            municipality of Eindhoven to address the challenges
                            youth workers face in navigating the rapidly
                            changing online world, where Dutch youth spend an
                            average of 6 to 7 hours per day. The municipality
                            has commissioned Garage2020 to develop an innovation
                            to enhance the digital footprint of youth work. The
                            current concept, known as the 'social sphere,' aims
                            to create a platform where youth workers can use
                            social media channels to engage and support young
                            people in Eindhoven. The project involves
                            collaboration with stakeholders like Fenna Dam and
                            Fontys to advance the initiative to the next phase.

                        <h3>Making of the archetype quiz AI</h3>
                        <p>
                            My assigned task in this group project was to
                            create a archetype quiz. The challenge
                            was not just about crafting an engaging quiz but
                            ensuring its accuracy and relevance for our target
                            audience—youth workers.

                            <br>
                            <div class="flexi">  <p>In my quest for the perfect dataset, I opted for the
                                Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset, renowned
                                for its scientific utility and reliability. This
                                rich dataset contained textual information
                                intricately linked to personality types. Inspired by
                                the MBTI's four dichotomies, I grouped the
                                personality types into four distinct archetypes,
                                aligning with our project's focus on youth workers.</p> <img style="width: 200px;" src="belly-dancer-2873089_1920.png" alt=""> </div>
                          
                            <br>
                            The data journey kicked off with a thorough
                            exploration of the dataset—data understanding. This
                            involved unraveling the nuances of the text data and
                            discerning patterns that would later prove
                            instrumental in predicting archetypes. The
                            subsequent stage, data processing, was a meticulous
                            dance with the data, involving cleaning,
                            transformation, and feature engineering to prepare
                            it for the impending machine learning adventure.
                            <br>
                            The heart of the project lay in the development of
                            the AI model. Armed with the pre-processed data, I
                            experimented with various machine learning models,
                            ranging from logistic regressions to support vector
                            machines (SVM), seeking the optimal algorithm that
                            would best predict archetypes. The climax of this
                            endeavor was an impressive 77% accuracy, a testament
                            to the efficacy of the chosen model.
                            <br> <br>

                                the end-user experience. I constructed a
                                user-friendly quiz tailored for our target audience.
                                This quiz, designed to predict the archetype
                                personality of young workers, hinged on the
                                open-ended responses they provided. The results were
                                nothing short of insightful, providing each
                                participant with a personalized archetype, a
                                detailed description, and accuracy scores indicating
                                their alignment with each archetype.</p></div>
                     
                            <br>
                            Taking the project a step further, I endeavored to
                            make this tool accessible to my group members. Enter
                            JavaScript—an essential tool in converting this AI
                            masterpiece into a web-friendly format. This
                            transition not only widened the usability of the
                            archetype quiz but also showcased the
                            interdisciplinary nature of our project.
                            <br>
                            In essence, my contribution to the group project
                            evolved from data exploration and machine learning
                            model development to the creation of a user-friendly
                            quiz, culminating in a seamless integration of the
                            AI into a JavaScript-powered interface. The journey
                            was an exploration of the intersection between data
                            science and user experience, making the complex
                            world of AI accessible and engaging for our target
                            audience.
