<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>
                            Garage2020 is collaborating closely with the
                            municipality of Eindhoven to address the challenges
                            youth workers face in navigating the rapidly
                            changing online world, where Dutch youth spend an
                            average of 6 to 7 hours per day. The municipality
                            has commissioned Garage2020 to develop an innovation
                            to enhance the digital footprint of youth work. <br>
                            The
                            current concept, known as the <b>'social sphere,'</b>
                            <i>aims
                                to create a platform where youth workers can use
                                social media channels to engage and support
                                young
                                people in Eindhoven.</i> The project involves
                            collaboration with stakeholders like Fenna Dam and
                            Fontys to advance the initiative to the next phase.
                        </p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>I will be describing what only I did during this project duration, but still giving overall context of the overall project. Therefor the chaptering may seem odd at first, but I have tried to still tie it all together</p>

<a target="_blank" class="t" href="ProjectPlan-GroupsProject.pdf">Project plan</a>   
<p>First off was making the project plan. We started by defining our problem and making research questions, I can say that I thought of the main research question, and then proceeeded to split this into 5 sub-questions. 
 We then did some brainstorming on what we could make, by also looking at what the previous group made. I came up with a sub-realistic idea to use AI to monitor the youth <img src="MicrosoftTeams-image (1).png" alt=""> This idea ended up getting watered down allot, but still being used in the final product as the AI archetype predictor. <br> I was also assigned the role of Scrum master, overseeing the trello and stand-ups. <a href="https://trello.com/b/BKdSlzYt/groep-4">Trello</a>
 even though no specific group leader was appointed throughout the project, I was the overal overseer of the groups workflow, which is surprising since usually the project leader ends up being the person who speaks the loudests, which in a group full of 1 girl and 5 guys, you woulldnt think id be me, but oh well. I also made the persona depicted in the project plan. Then the sub-research questions were divided into DOT frameworks and split up between the group members. I was in charge of research question 2 and 3.

</div>    
<p>We started the research by reading all the document provided by the previous who worked on this document, we then concluded the most important parts into a single document,   <a  target="_blank" href="SamenvattingProjectEersteGroep-GroupsProject.pdf">Initial research</a> 
</p> <p>Next up I went into my assigned research question, I made an <a target="_blank" href="Deelvraag3.pdf">exploraty literary study</a> , In this exploration, I have delved into the development of an online education platform and the advantages associated with it. The discussion covered the use of various frameworks for website development, emphasizing content management systems (CMS) for website transferability. A comparative analysis was also conducted between Joomla and WordPress. Additionally, insights were shared on the implementation of headless CMS, and a brief examination of popular online learning platforms, such as Coursera and edX, was provided.

    Throughout the investigation, the advantages and disadvantages of different tools and platforms were highlighted. It is clear that choices depend on factors like project complexity, user skill level, and specific website requirements. The information gathered from various sources has been presented in the first-person form to convey a personal engagement with the subject matter.</p>

</div>

                        <p>In continuing the 'Social Sphere' project, we've
                            <b>drawn inspiration from the groundwork laid by the
                                previous group.</b> They envisioned categorizing
                            youth
                            workers into archetypes, a strategy aimed at
                            providing deeper insights into their strengths and
                            areas of expertise. To build upon this concept, we've
                            delved into the realm of personality assessments,
                            specifically leveraging the Myers-Briggs Type
                            Indicator (MBTI) and scientifically-backed
                            archetypes.
                            <br>
                            The MBTI, a widely recognized and respected
                            personality framework, classifies individuals based
                            on psychological preferences in how they perceive
                            the world and make decisions. This tool provides a
                            nuanced understanding of various personality traits,
                            allowing us to <b>tailor archetypes that resonate
                                with
                                the unique qualities of youth workers.</b>
                            <br>
                            Our approach involves aligning MBTI personality
                            types with specific archetypes, creating a more
                            refined and individualized framework for
                            categorization. By tapping into the scientific
                            backing of the MBTI, we aim to enhance the accuracy
                            and relevance of the archetypes, ensuring they go
                            beyond mere labels to genuinely capture the diverse
                            strengths and characteristics of youth workers.
                            <br>We wanted these archetypes to resonate visually.
                            Cue the adorable characters – each crafted to embody
                            the unique qualities of the final four archetypes.

                            Our design process aimed to strike a <b>balance between
                                cuteness and representation</b>. Whether it's the
                            nurturing archetype exuding warmth or the analytical
                            archetype sporting a studious demeanor, each
                            character was refined through iterations to capture
                            both the essence of the personality types and an
                            irresistibly cute appeal. <img src="archetypes.png"
                                alt>The journey of bringing our
                            scientifically-backed archetypes to life doesn't end
                            with static characters; we've ventured into the
                            captivating realm of <b>2D animation using After
                                Effects </b>to infuse dynamic charm into these

                            My assigned task in this group project was to
                            create a archetype quiz. The challenge
                            was not just about crafting an engaging quiz but
                            ensuring its accuracy and relevance for our target
                            audience—youth workers.
                         
                            <br>
                            <div class="flexi"> <p>In my quest for the perfect
                                    dataset, I opted for the
                                    Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset,
                                    renowned
                                    for its scientific utility and reliability.
                                    This
                                    rich dataset contained textual information
                                    intricately linked to personality types.
                                    Inspired by
                                    the MBTI's four dichotomies, I grouped the
                                    personality types into four distinct
                                    archetypes,
                                    aligning with our project's focus on youth
                                    workers.</p> <img style="width: 200px;"

                            </div>

                            <br>
                            The data journey kicked off with a thorough
                            exploration of the dataset—data understanding. This
                            involved unraveling the nuances of the text data and
                            discerning patterns that would later prove
                            instrumental in predicting archetypes. The
                            subsequent stage, data processing, was a meticulous
                            dance with the data, involving cleaning,
                            transformation, and feature engineering to prepare
                            it for the impending machine learning adventure.
                            <br>
                            The heart of the project lay in the development of
                            the AI model. Armed with the pre-processed data, I
                            experimented with various machine learning models,
                            ranging from logistic regressions to support vector
                            machines (SVM), seeking the optimal algorithm that
                            would best predict archetypes. The climax of this
                            endeavor was an impressive 77% accuracy, a testament
                            to the efficacy of the chosen model.
                            <br> <br>
                            <div class="flexi"><img style="width: 200px;"
                                    src="woman-7393953_1920.png" alt><p> With
                                    the AI performing admirably, I shifted focus
                                    to
                                    the end-user experience. I constructed a
                                    user-friendly quiz tailored for our target
                                    audience.
                                    This quiz, designed to predict the archetype
                                    personality of young workers, hinged on the
                                    open-ended responses they provided. The
                                    results were
                                    nothing short of insightful, providing each
                                    participant with a personalized archetype, a
                                    detailed description, and accuracy scores
                                    indicating
                                    their alignment with each archetype.</p></div>

                            <br>
                            Taking the project a step further, I endeavored to
                            make this tool accessible to my group members. Enter
                            JavaScript—an essential tool in converting this AI
                            masterpiece into a web-friendly format. This
                            transition not only widened the usability of the
                            archetype quiz but also showcased the
                            interdisciplinary nature of our project.
                            <br>
                            In essence, my contribution to the group project
                            evolved from data exploration and machine learning
                            model development to the creation of a user-friendly
                            quiz, culminating in a seamless integration of the
                            AI into a JavaScript-powered interface. The journey
                            was an exploration of the intersection between data
                            science and user experience, making the complex
                            world of AI accessible and engaging for our target

    I was in charge of making educational content for a social platform. I started by going through the files from stakeholders and divided them into 7 sections, each with different chapters. This way, we could cover many subjects on the website. After getting feedback, we added just one more module, so I think I did well.</p>
<p>While creating the lessons, I looked into online challenges for young people. I made content about cyberbullying, addiction, spotting fake news, and understanding the impact of unrealistic standards. I gave tips to youth workers, offering practical advice for their important roles. </p>
<br>

I also made content for different types of youth workers, like Visionaries, Organizers, Connectors, and Guides. Each lesson aimed to help them positively influence young people dealing with online challenges. 
<br>
I also created lessons about online youth crime and the changing world of social media. I made quizzes to make learning more fun and interactive for those wanting to understand and tackle challenges in the online world.
<br>
As the lessons came together, I worked on simplifying and shortening the content. I wanted to make sure the information was not only helpful but also easy for youth workers to understand and relate to. Writing these lessons was a great experience, combining insights, research, and creativity to contribute to the important field of youth work in the digital age.</p>
<p>To be super specific I made the modules, <a target="_blank" href="Cyberpesten.docx">Cyberbullying</a> , <a target="_blank" href="SocialeDruk.docx">Sociale pressure</a> , and  <a target="_blank" href="Werkwijze.docx">workways</a></p>
