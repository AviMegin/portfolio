                            Garage2020 collaborates closely with the
                            municipality of Eindhoven. The municipality has
                            commissioned them to develop an innovation that
                            helps youth workers to navigate the rapidly changing
                            online world in which a large part of young people
                            are active. According to research conducted by
                            Garage2020, Dutch youth spend an average of 6 to 7
                            hours online per day. Youth work is not prepared for
                            this. The field is trying to increase its digital
                            footprint, but outside of digital activities (such

                            Dynamo, but physically) it has not been very
                            successful. The problem is that online activities
                            and online methods to connect youth workers with
                            young people are still virtually

                        <p>
                            As a college student embarking on a fascinating
                            group project, my journey began with the exciting
                            task of creating an archetype quiz AI. The challenge
                            was not just about crafting an engaging quiz but
                            ensuring its accuracy and relevance for our target
                            audience—young workers.

                            In my quest for the perfect dataset, I opted for the
                            Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset, renowned
                            for its scientific utility and reliability. This
                            rich dataset contained textual information
                            intricately linked to personality types. Inspired by
                            the MBTI's four dichotomies, I grouped the
                            personality types into four distinct archetypes,
                            aligning with our project's focus on young workers.

                            The data journey kicked off with a thorough
                            exploration of the dataset—data understanding. This
                            involved unraveling the nuances of the text data and
                            discerning patterns that would later prove
                            instrumental in predicting archetypes. The
                            subsequent stage, data processing, was a meticulous
                            dance with the data, involving cleaning,
                            transformation, and feature engineering to prepare
                            it for the impending machine learning adventure.

                            The heart of the project lay in the development of
                            the AI model. Armed with the pre-processed data, I
                            experimented with various machine learning models,
                            ranging from logistic regressions to support vector
                            machines (SVM), seeking the optimal algorithm that
                            would best predict archetypes. The climax of this
                            endeavor was an impressive 77% accuracy, a testament
                            to the efficacy of the chosen model.

                            With the AI performing admirably, I shifted focus to
                            the end-user experience. I constructed a
                            user-friendly quiz tailored for our target audience.
                            This quiz, designed to predict the archetype
                            personality of young workers, hinged on the
                            open-ended responses they provided. The results were
                            nothing short of insightful, providing each
                            participant with a personalized archetype, a
                            detailed description, and accuracy scores indicating
                            their alignment with each archetype.

                            Taking the project a step further, I endeavored to
                            make this tool accessible to my group members. Enter
                            JavaScript—an essential tool in converting this AI
                            masterpiece into a web-friendly format. This
                            transition not only widened the usability of the
                            archetype quiz but also showcased the
                            interdisciplinary nature of our project.

                            In essence, my contribution to the group project
                            evolved from data exploration and machine learning
                            model development to the creation of a user-friendly
                            quiz, culminating in a seamless integration of the
                            AI into a JavaScript-powered interface. The journey
                            was an exploration of the intersection between data
                            science and user experience, making the complex
                            world of AI accessible and engaging for our target
                            audience.

                                filter out until I have a solid

                                will not train it to copy my
                                personality. This will create a

                                <b>More engaging: </b>A chatbot AI can
                                create more interactive and
                                immersive experiences for my
                                portfolio visitors. For example,
                                I could create a chatbot that
                                takes visitors on a virtual tour
                                of my portfolio, or that allows
                                them to ask questions about my
                                work in a more conversational
                                way. <br>
                                <b>More innovative: </b>A chatbot AI
                                demonstrates my skills in areas
                                such as artificial intelligence,
                                machine learning, and natural
                                language processing.
                                In addition to these benefits, I
                                believe that adding a chatbot AI
                                to my portfolio will help me to
                                stand out from the competition
                                and to make a positive
                                impression on potential
                                employers.
                                I am excited to experiment with
                                different ways to use a chatbot
                                AI in my portfolio. I think it
                                has the potential to be a really
                                valuable asset and to help me to
                                create a truly unique and
                                memorable experience for my
                                visitors.

                            <p>Prototyping enables iterative
                                design by allowing designers to
                                quickly make changes and
                                improvements based on feedback,
                                without the need for extensive
                                coding or development. This
                                saves time in the design

                                through prototyping helps
                                prevent rework during
                                development, ultimately saving
