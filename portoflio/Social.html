                            Garage2020 collaborates closely with the
                            municipality of Eindhoven. The municipality has
                            commissioned them to develop an innovation that
                            helps youth workers to navigate the rapidly changing
                            online world in which a large part of young people
                            are active. According to research conducted by
                            Garage2020, Dutch youth spend an average of 6 to 7
                            hours online per day. Youth work is not prepared for
                            this. The field is trying to increase its digital
                            footprint, but outside of digital activities (such
                            as game events and editing workshops offered by
                            Dynamo, but physically) it has not been very
                            successful. The problem is that online activities
                            and online methods to connect youth workers with
                            young people are still virtually
                            non-existent.Currently, the current concept for this
                            problem is the 'social sphere'. This will be a
                            platform where youth workers can learn how to use
                            social media channels to engage with and support /
                            inform online youth in Eindhoven using gamification
                            elements. Stakeholder Fenna Dam has again partnered
                            with Fontys to take this project to the next phase.

                            <p>I decided to make a competitive
                                analysis to look up inspiration
                                for what a portfolio website
                                looks like, and compare my ideas
                                and see what is a universal
                                theme that people use, this will
                                make my website less confusing
                                and familiar to the target
                                audience.</p><p>So first I found a portfolio
                                website hub, that contains alot
                                of portfolio websites, below I
                                will show which ones caught my
                                eye. I will take inspiration and
                                make a list of potential
                                additions to my portfolio, I
                                will then do further research
                                into each one of them to see if
                                it is realistic to add them, and
                                filter out until I have a solid
                                list of extra widgets and ideas
                                for the portfolio</p>
                            <b>Results</b>
                            <p>Overall the feel of the websites
                                is the same, the endless
                                scrolling is something that
                                bothered me, so i will not be
                                doing that for my portfolio. But
                                I have created a nice list of
                                additions that I personally
                                enjoy, I will be making a
                                prototype for my idea and see if
                                the world agrees with my vision</p></div>

                                because it will make it more

                                can answer questions about my
                                portfolio and provide visitors
                                with more information about my
                                work. I will train the chatbot
                                to have a comprehensive
                                knowledge of my projects, but I
                                will not train it to copy my
                                personality. This will create a
                                certain barrier between ethics,
                                by putting up these boundaries. <br>

                                portfolio visitors. For example,
                                I could create a chatbot that
                                takes visitors on a virtual tour
                                of my portfolio, or that allows
                                them to ask questions about my
                                work in a more conversational
                                way. <br>
