                    <p>Our project is a short 2-minute video inspired by the
                        Dutch Design Week. It showcases a striking
                        contradiction: <b>despite many artists promoting
                            sustainability, most still use paper business cards</b>.
                        We
                        highlight this by creating a tree out of these collected
                        business cards and then throwing them in the trash,
                        where they all end up anyway.

                        The video's story is about how artists say they care
                        about the environment but use things that harm it. By
                        throwing the cards in the trash, we show that these
                        cards, meant to represent creativity, just become waste.
                        We want artists and viewers to think about using more
                        eco-friendly stuff to promote their work.

                        Our short video aims to make people think about how what
                        we say about the environment should match what we do. It
                        hopes to start a conversation about using more
                        eco-friendly ways to promote art, pushing for better
                        practices in the artistic community.</p>

                    <b>Day 1</b>
                    <p> We started this day with a short introduction of the
                        event and meeting the Toronto student Aisha. We then had
                        to come up with a planning for the following three days.
                        We started by choosing which ‘Dutch Design Week – Theme’
                        we would like to focus on. We have chosen for theme 9:
                        Signature and collectible design. This theme primarily
                        focusses on the individual expression of the artist,
                        translated into a design or object. This theme spoke to
                        us because we think it is important you can express your
                        ideas, emotions, and values through art. This will make
                        you think about what you will contribute and makes you
                        strive to be unique. After choosing a theme, we looked
                        at the DDW-map and create a route. A couple of
                        activities on the route relates to our theme, some
                        activities were an extra we would like to see. Most of
                        the activities were in the city centrum of Eindhoven,
                        making use of the nice weather The Tuesday activities
                        are mostly in Strijp-s.</p>

                    <br>
                    <b>Day 2</b>
                    <p>We started this day by meeting each other in front of
                        the Strijp TQ building. We then spent the whole day
                        around the area of Strijp, mostly S and T. This time
                        around we decided that we split up because there was
                        so
                        much to see. The area of Strijp has a nice layout
                        and a
                        cosy middle place where we all could meetup during
                        the
                        day. </p>
